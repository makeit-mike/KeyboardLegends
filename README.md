# KeyboardLegends
A personal repo to keep track of the way I tend to program each of my keyboards in my rotation. Some are built using QMK, others using Kaleidoscope.

This is also another way I use to practice C programming. It isn't super intensive by any means, but good to familiarize myself with the syntax.

Current Keyboards in my rotation:
1. Leopold FC660C (Hasu Mod using VIA, TOPRE)
2. Ergodox EZ (Gateron Silent Blacks)
3. SplitKB Kyria (Matais Quiet Click (ALPS style))
4. Keebio Iris rev4 (Boba u4t 68g)
5. Keyboard.io Atreus (Zeal Helios)
6. Unicomp Model M (IBM Buckling Springs)
7. Cherry G80 w/ TKC1800 PCB. (Matais Quite Tactile (ALPS style))
8. Cherry G80 (Cherry MX (vintage) silent Black)


Upcoming builds:
- gerald65 (Arisu style build. Will most likely use Gateron Ink Blacks)
