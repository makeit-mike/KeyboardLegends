# KeyboardLegends
A personal repo to keep track of the way I tend to program each of my keyboards in my rotation. Some are built using QMK, others using Kaleidoscope.



Current Keyboards in my rotation:
1. Ergodox EZ (Box Whites)
2. Keebio Iris rev4 (Boba Thocky)
3. Keyboard.io Atreus (Boba u4 68g)
4. Unicomp Model M (IBM Buckling Springs)
5. Cherry G80 w/ TKC1800 PCB. (Matais Quite Tactile (alps style))


Upcoming builds:
- Kyria with Gateron Silent Blacks, Using Elite C mc.
- Another 1800 layout board sometime, I want to build a non-alps version, and desperately want it to have a plate.
